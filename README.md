## Objectives

Count the elements in an Array by returning a hash whose keys are the elements and values the number of times they occur.
  
## Example

Here's an example of ideal behaviour:

```ruby
animals = ['tortoise', 'aye-aye', 'honey badger', 'aye-aye', 'tortoise', 'tortoise']
count_elements(animals)
# => {'tortoise' => 3, 'aye-aye' => 2, 'honey badger' => 1}
```

## Instructions

Add code to `count_elements.rb`. Run your testing suite to get started.
